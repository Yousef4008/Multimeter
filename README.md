# Auto-Ranging Multimeter Project

## Overview
This project implements an Auto-Ranging Multimeter using the ATmega32 microcontroller. It includes various measurement functionalities such as resistance, voltage, capacitance, inductance, and current measurement using the ACS712ELCTR-20A-T sensor.

## Key Features
- **Resistance Measurement**: Utilizes the voltage divider principle to accurately measure resistance.
- **Voltage Measurement**: Measures voltage across components using the voltage divider principle.
- **Capacitance Measurement**: Uses the charging principle to determine capacitance values.
- **Inductance Measurement**: Measures inductance using the resonance frequency of an LC circuit.
- **Current Measurement**: Utilizes the ACS712ELCTR-20A-T sensor to measure DC and AC currents.

## Repository Structure
- **Multimeter_WS/**: Contains the source code for the Auto-Ranging Multimeter.
- **Multimeter Proteus Simulation/**: Includes Proteus simulation files for testing the multimeter's functionality.
